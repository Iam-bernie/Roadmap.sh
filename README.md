1. **Open the Files**
- Navigate to the folder containing the HTML files.
- Open any of the HTML files (`index.html`, `projects.html`, `articles.html`, or `contact.html`) in a web browser by double-clicking the file or dragging it into the browser window.
- Alternatively, right-click the file and select "Open with" your preferred web browser.

2. **Explore the Website**
- Use the navigation bar at the top of each page to navigate between Home, Projects, Articles, and Contact pages.
- The website is fully functional locally without needing a server, as it uses only HTML and CSS.

## Project Structure
- **HTML Structure**: Each page uses semantic HTML5 elements (e.g., `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<footer>`) for accessibility and SEO.
- **Navigation**: A consistent navigation bar links all pages together.
- **Styling**: The `styles.css` file provides a professional, responsive design with a modern color scheme and typography.
- **SEO**: Meta tags in the `<head>` of each page include `charset`, `viewport`, `description`, `keywords`, and `author` for search engine optimization.

## Notes
- The website is designed to be styled further or modified as needed for future projects.
- No JavaScript or backend server is required to run this project locally.
- Ensure all files (`index.html`, `projects.html`, `articles.html`, `contact.html`, and `styles.css`) are in the same directory for proper linking.
